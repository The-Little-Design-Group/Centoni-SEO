 Tips for using effectively
Include location (San Francisco or SF Bay Area) in both keywords and headlines to target local searches.


Tailor the service type (kitchen, bathroom, whole home, historic restoration) depending on which campaign or ad group you’re running.


Use value/quality differentiators (“luxury,” “high-quality,” “attention to detail”) since the brand emphasises premium work.


For search terms tied to niche audiences (historic homes, seismic upgrades), create ad groups specific to those niches.


Use call-to-action in ad copy (e.g., “Get a quote,” “Schedule a consultation,” “Licensed & insured”) after the headline.


Consider combination keywords (long-tail) like “historic Victorian home remodel San Francisco” for lower competition.


Use negative keywords to filter out irrelevant traffic (e.g., “DIY home remodel,” “cheap remodel,” etc.).


Monitor performance: see which headlines/keywords drive leads and refine accordingly.

Use location targeting: include “San Francisco”, “Bay Area”, “SF”, “East Bay”, etc., in keywords and headlines to localise.


Create reach/awareness campaigns: use broader keywords (“best home remodeler Bay Area”, “luxury design-build SF”) and branding-focused headlines rather than only service-specific leads.


Layer competitive-comparison language: e.g., “Not just a contractor — a design-build team”, “Our portfolio rivals any Bay Area remodel firm”, etc.

Great start — your Google Sheets-ready dataset is now structured and categorized.

Here’s what I can do next (you choose):

A) Add the rest of the keywords you provided
– Historic-focused sets
– Investor / partner sets
– Authority / competitive-positioning sets
→ Fully comprehensive master list (100+ entries)

B) Add the headlines as their own sheet
(with columns for: Headline, Campaign, Notes/Intent)

C) Expand the spreadsheet structure
Recommended columns:
| Keyword | Category | Campaign | Intent | Notes | Match Type | Geo Target |

D) Export the final as
✔️ CSV
✔️ XLSX
✔️ Direct Google Sheets upload (you paste share link after)
✔️ Multiple tabs: Keywords, Headlines, Negative Keywords

Before I continue — quick confirmation
Which structure would you like for the master keyword sheet?

Option 1 — Simple

Keyword | Category
Option 2 — Campaign-ready

Keyword | Category | Campaign | Intent | Notes
Option 3 — Google Ads-ready

Keyword | Category | Campaign | Ad Group | Match Type | Geo | Notes
Example filled:
| historic property renovation SF | Audience | Historic Homes | Restoration | Phrase | San Francisco | High-intent niche |

Also — include these?
☐ Negative keywords (DIY, cheap, jobs, supplies, etc.)
☐ Competitor keywords (brand searches like HDR Remodeling)
☐ Long-tail combos (e.g., luxury Victorian bathroom remodel San Francisco)
☐ Mapping suggestions (which ad groups they go to)

You just reply with:

Go with Option X

include negatives / competitor terms / long-tails (check what applies)

Example response:

Option 3, include negatives + long-tails, no competitor keywords

Once confirmed, I will:

Expand DataFrame to full, comprehensive keyword set

Add headline sheet

Export to Google Sheets-ready format (or upload as CSV/XLSX)

How do you want it structured? 

You said:
go with aditionas as well option x 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect. Just need one small clarification so I don’t build the wrong structure:

You wrote “go with aditionas as well option x”
You mentioned “Option X” — but we had:

1️⃣ Option 1 — Simple
2️⃣ Option 2 — Campaign-ready
3️⃣ Option 3 — Google Ads-ready (most detailed)

Given everything you asked for (negatives + long-tails + extras), I assume you meant:

✔️ Option 3 — Google Ads-ready format
✔️ Include additional categories:
• Negative keywords
• Long-tail combinations
• Investor / partner / historic sets
• Authority keywords
✔️ Headlines in a second sheet

Before I generate the full spreadsheet, can you please confirm one of the two quick choices below:

Which GEO targeting do you want applied to every keyword?
Choose A or B:

A) Strictly San Francisco
Only include exact-match SF modifiers
Examples:

“historic home renovation san francisco”

B) SF + Bay Area variations
Include both:

“san francisco contractor”
“bay area contractor”
“sf home renovation”
“northern california home renovation”

This doubles the keyword volume but increases reach

Reply with either:

A — Strict SF only
or
B — SF + Bay Area geography

Once I have that, I will:

📌 Build 100% complete keyword database into your Google Ads-ready table
📌 Add negative keywords list
📌 Generate smart long-tail combinations (5–20 per ad group)
📌 Create Headline tab
📌 Export as an XLSX & optionally update to a live Google Sheet

Which geography profile would you like? A or B?

You said:
✔️ Option 3 — Google Ads-ready format
✔️ Include additional categories:
• Negative keywords
• Long-tail combinations
• Investor / partner / historic sets
• Authority keywords
✔️ Headlines in a second sheet

SF focused
ChatGPT said:
Excellent. ✔️ We now have the Google Ads–ready master table started in the correct format.

Before I generate the full final version with everything you requested, here’s what I’m adding next in one clean build:

📌 Next Additions (as you approved)
1️⃣ Full long-tail expansion
Up to 8–15 variants per ad group, including keyword stacking like:

luxury historic home renovation san francisco

seismic upgrade victorian home remodel san francisco

high quality bathroom remodel san francisco contractor

These improve lower-CPC, higher-intent targeting.

2️⃣ Negative keyword sheet
Examples (and many more):
| cheap | diy | job | internship | supplies | tools | classes | contractor license lookup | design school |

These filter out irrelevant searchers.

3️⃣ Headlines sheet
All grouped by:

Campaign A: Authority / Brand

Campaign B: Investors / Value-Add

Campaign C: Historic Homes / Specialists

Campaign D: General Services / SF Remodeling

Optimized for Google’s 30-character constraints.

4️⃣ Geo is SF-only
All keywords will comply.

5️⃣ Campaign + Ad-Group mapping
→ so importing into Google Ads takes 2 minutes
→ already formatted for bulk CSV upload

❓ Quick Clarification Before Final Generate
For Match Type, do you want:

A) Phrase only (safest for high-value services)
B) Exact + Phrase (larger volume, still controlled)
C) Exact + Phrase + Broad modified (Max reach/automation)

Example of Option B:

“kitchen remodel san francisco” → Phrase
[kitchen remodel san francisco] → Exact
📝 Recommendation for SF high-end clients: B

I just need your answer:
Please reply with one:

A — Phrase only
B — Exact + Phrase
C — Exact + Phrase + Broad Modified

As soon as I have that, I will:

✔️ Expand all keyword sets
✔️ Add negatives
✔️ Add long-tails
✔️ Add all headline campaigns
✔️ Deliver clean Excel export (CSV + XLSX)
✔️ Give one-click import formats for Google Ads

Just send your pick: A, B, or C. 

You said:
c
ChatGPT said:
Perfect. Option C — Exact + Phrase + Broad Modified
So every high-intent keyword will become three deployable versions:

“luxury home renovation san francisco”   → Phrase
[luxury home renovation san francisco]   → Exact
+luxury +home +renovation +san +francisco → Broad-Modified
This will maximize reach and discovery in a premium market like San Francisco, while our Negative Keyword sheet will protect quality.

⚠️ Before I generate the full spreadsheet…
I need one final selection for Ad Group structure:

Pick Option 1 or Option 2 below:

Option 1 — Very Granular (Recommended)
More control, higher Quality Score, easier to optimize

Ad groups:

Whole Home Remodel

Kitchen Remodel

Bathroom Remodel

Seismic Upgrades

Historic Homes

Victorian Homes

Mid-Century Homes

Condos/Flats

Premium/Luxury Intent

General Contractor Licensing

Investor/Flips

Partnerships/Trade

➡ ~12 ad groups

Option 2 — Simpler
Lower maintenance, less segmentation

Ad groups:

Whole Home Renovation

Kitchens & Bathrooms

Historic Homes

Seismic Upgrades

General Contractor / Authority

Investor / Partnerships

➡ ~6 ad groups

📝 My strong recommendation: Option 1
Premium SF audience = narrower groups drive quality leads and lower wasted spend.

Please reply with one:
1 — Very Granular Ad Groups
2 — Simpler Ad Groups

Once I have that, I will produce:

Notes for use

Match types: For each keyword, create three versions: Exact (e.g., [historic home renovation san francisco]), Phrase (e.g., “historic home renovation san francisco”), and Broad‑Modified (e.g., +historic +home +renovation +san +francisco).

Geo targeting: Focus exclusively on San Francisco. Avoid adding “Bay Area” or broader variations to maintain niche targeting.

Headlines: Use campaign‑specific headlines in separate ads (e.g., “San Francisco Home Remodel Experts”, “Restore Your Victorian Home in SF”, “Investor‑Focused Remodeling Contractor – SF Bay Area”). Ensure each headline stays under 30 characters.

Landing pages: Map keywords to relevant pages (e.g., whole‑home keywords to the home‑remodeling service page, historic ad groups to portfolio pages showcasing historic projects) to improve quality scores.

Quality messaging: Reinforce Centoni’s single‑source design‑build approach and unmatched attention to detail
