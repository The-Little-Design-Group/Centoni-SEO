## Quick Reference

### Target Audience Segments

| Segment | Description | Primary Intent |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Historic Home Owners | Victorian, Arts and Crafts, Mid-Century owners | Preservation with modernization |
| Luxury Clients | High-net-worth homeowners | Premium whole-home transformations |
| Real Estate Investors | Property flippers and investors | Value-add renovations for ROI |
| Trade Partners | Contractors seeking partnerships | Design-build collaboration |

### Campaign Structure

The Google Ads account should be organized into four primary campaigns:

1. **Authority / Brand Reach** - General contractor and premium positioning
2. **Historic Homes** - Victorian, Mid-Century, Arts and Crafts focus
3. **Investor / Value-Add** - Flip-ready and investment property targeting
4. **Partnerships** - Trade partner and contractor collaboration

### Match Type Strategy

All keywords deploy in three match types:
- Exact: `[keyword phrase]`
- Phrase: `"keyword phrase"`
- Broad Modified: `+keyword +phrase`

## For Team Members

### Getting Started

1. Review the `docs/ENVIRONMENT_AUDIT.md` for complete project context
2. Study `docs/KEYWORD_GUIDE.md` for educational background on SEM concepts
3. Reference `docs/CAMPAIGN_STRATEGY.md` for implementation details
4. Use data files in `data/` for campaign builds

### Key Principles

**Quality Over Quantity**
We target high-intent, premium keywords rather than high-volume generic terms. San Francisco's renovation market commands premium pricing, and our keyword strategy reflects this positioning.

**Geographic Precision**
All keywords include San Francisco geographic modifiers. We do not target broader "Bay Area" terms without SF specificity to maintain lead quality.

**Negative Keyword Discipline**
Robust negative keyword implementation protects ad spend from unqualified traffic (DIY seekers, job hunters, budget shoppers).
